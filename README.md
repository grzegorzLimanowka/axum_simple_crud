# Axum Simple Crud

Goal of this project was to write REST service, which will support basic CRUD operations for simple data structures with few fields. Required operations:

- GET
- CREATE
- UPDATE
- DELETE

Also - data has to be saved in a map, which must be available for each HTTP request (implement simple cache solution).
